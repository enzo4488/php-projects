Tic-Tac-Toe Game in PHP

Overview

This is a web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game developed using PHP. It serves as a demonstration of key PHP development skills including front-end and back-end integration, session management, data storage, and user interface development.

Goal of this project is so I get hands-on experience developing a seemingly uncomplicated game using PHP. Turns out, there's a lot of moving parts into making it work.

Features added:

1. Functional Tic-Tac-Toe Game: Created a working Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows for player moves and checks for winning conditions.
2. Integration with Backend: Successfully integrated the frontend HTML/JavaScript with PHP on the backend using AJAX, allowing for a dynamic and responsive gameplay experience.
3. Session Management: Utilized PHP sessions to keep track of the game state and current player.
4. Error Handling: Included various error-handling mechanisms to ensure the application behaves as expected in various scenarios, like invalid moves.
5. Enhanced User Experience: Modified the game so that players can click directly on the board rather than using a form, making the gameplay more intuitive.
6. Board Reset Functionality: Added a functional "Reset Board" button.
7. Styling: Improved the aesthetic of the game board to make it more modern and visually appealing. Also, styled the button and centered the title.

Features to implement:
-Integrate working user authentication that the user needs to go through to play
-Feedback mechanisms and visual indicators like a working scoreboard and pop-up messages
